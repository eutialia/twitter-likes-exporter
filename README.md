# Twitter Likes Exporter

Hacky Python scripts for downloading your Twitter likes and converting to HTML. Includes support for downloading user avatars and image/video media in tweets. Scrapes tweets using the GraphQL API powering Twitter.com - the equivalent of you scrolling through all your likes in your web browser, only saved locally forever!

Note only currently supports grabbing the liked tweet. So if it was a quote tweet, does not download the RT'd tweet. If it's a reply or part of a thread, does not download the other tweets.

Meant to jumpstart you to at least getting your tweets offline from Twitter, if not building something much better!

## Setup

Intended for use with Python 3.7. First install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(It's just `requests`). Next you'll need to populate the `config.json` file with credentials needed to match how your web browser gets your likes from Twitter.com:

1. Open up your web browser and ensure the Network web debugging tab is open so you can inspect network requests
2. Navigate to `https://twitter.com/<your_user_handle>/likes`
3. Look for a network request to an `api.twitter.com` domain path ending in `/Likes`
4. From the request headers:
    a. Copy the `Authorization` value and save as `HEADER_AUTHORIZATION` in `config.json`
    b. Copy the `Cookies` value and save as `HEADER_COOKIES` in `config.json`
    c. Copy the `x-csrf-token` value and save as `HEADER_CSRF` in `config.json`
5. Find your Twitter user ID (available in the `/Likes` request params, or elsewhere) and save as `USER_ID` in `config.json`


### Download Likes to JSON

By default, liked tweets will be saved to a file `liked_tweets.json` in this repo's folder path. If you'd like to override this, set new path as `OUTPUT_JSON_FILE_PATH` in `config.json`.

Run as follows:

```bash
python download_tweets.py
```

Should provide output like the following:

```bash
Starting retrieval of likes for Twitter user 1234...
Fetching likes page: 1...
Fetching likes page: 2...
Fetching likes page: 3...
Done. Likes JSON saved to: liked_tweets.json
```

The output JSON will be a list of dictionaries like the following:

```json
[
   {
      "tweet_id": "780770946428829696",
      "user_id": "265447323",
      "user_handle": "LeahTiscione",
      "user_name": "Leah Tiscione",
      "user_avatar_url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1563330281838284805/aUtIY2vj_normal.jpg",
      "tweet_content":"What are you hiding in your locked instagram? sandwiches? Sunsets???? let us see your nephew!!!!",
      "tweet_media_urls": [],
      "tweet_video_urls": [],
      "tweet_created_at": "Sun Mar 13 15:16:45 +0000 2011"
   }
]
```


### Convert JSON Likes to HTML

If you want your tweets as a local HTML file, you can run the second script to convert the output JSON file from the above step.

NOTE: This will attempt to download all media images and videos and tweet author avatars locally by default to avoid relying on Twitter hosting.

1. Be sure the `OUTPUT_JSON_FILE_PATH` value in `config.json` is pointing to the output JSON file of your tweets.
2. Run:

```bash
python parse_tweets_json_to_html.py
```

This will download all images and videos (if specified; saved to `tweet_likes_html/images` and `tweet_likes_html/videos`) and construct an HTML file at `tweet_likes_html/index.html` containing all liked tweets, as well as individual HTML files within `tweet_likes_html/tweets/`.
